Professional Business Management Software.

## 🛠️ First-Time Setup (Fixing the "vite" Error)
If you see an error like `'vite' is not recognized`, it means you need to install the software dependencies first.

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
Open your terminal in this folder and run:
```bash
npm install
```
*This downloads the required libraries to your computer. You only need to do this once.*

### Step 2: Run the App
Once installation is complete, run:
```bash
npm run dev
```
*Then click the link (usually http://localhost:5173) to open the software.*

## ☁️ Deployment (For your Customer)
The easiest way for your customer to use this is via **Vercel**:
1. Upload these files to **GitHub**.
2. Link your GitHub to **Vercel.com**.
3. Vercel will give you a link (like `shree-ganesh.vercel.app`) that works on any phone or computer without installing anything.

## 🚀 Troubleshooting
- **Blank White Page?** Do not double-click `index.html`. Always use `npm run dev` or a hosting service like Vercel.
- **Node.js missing?** Download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) if you don't have it.
